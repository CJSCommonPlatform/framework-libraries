 * Postcode is made up of
 * <ol>
 * <li>outward postcode</li>
 * <li>space</li>
 * <li>inward postcode</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The outward postcode enables mail to be sent to the correct <br>
 * local area for delivery. <br>
 * This part of the code contains the area and the district to which <br>
 * the mail is to be delivered. <br>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The inward postcode is used to sort the mail at the local area <br>
 * delivery office. <br>
 * It consists of a numeric character followed by two alphabetic <br>
 * characters. The numeric character identifies the sector within <br>
 * the postal district. The alphabetic characters then define one <br>
 * or more properties within the sector. <br>
 * </p>
 * 
 * Example: PO1 3AX
 * <p>
 * PO refers to the postcode area of Portsmouth <br>
 * There are 124 postcode areas in the UK
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * PO1 refers to a postcode district within the postcode area of <br>
 * Portsmouth. <br>
 * There are approximately 2,900 postcode districts.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * PO1 3 refers to the postcode sector. <br>
 * There are approximately 9,650 postcode sectors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * PO1 3AX. The AX completes the postcode. The last two letters define the <br>
 * ‘unit postcode’ which identifies one or more small user delivery points <br>
 * or an individual large user.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are approximately 1.71 million unit postcodes in the UK.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Valid Formats: A indicates an alphabetic character and N indicates a numeric character
